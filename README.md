## Overview

Our final project for codefellows 301

**User Story:** As a dog owner, I want to be able to find a list of dog parks in the seattle area. Iâ€™d like to be able to filter these parks by different criteria such as dog size, terrain (i.e. beach, forest) off-leash, and other useful criteria. I also want to be able to find nearby dog-friendly businesses I can take my dogs to on doggy dates after the park! I would also like to be able to save a list of my favorite parks and be able to reference them later.

## Getting Started

Build the wireframe, connect to the api, send and post the data via full stack app to ejs, render it.

## Architecture

express, superagent, cors, ejs, morgan, pg.
